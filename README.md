This project is a locally hosted restaurant finder for Atlanta Georgia. The app features an aesthetic landing page that leads to a search function tied 
to a map with the results placed on it, login/sign-up pages, user settings, review searches and writing, and more lesser functions.
This website is locally hosted and made within the Django framework.
